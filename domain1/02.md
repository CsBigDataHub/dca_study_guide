## State the differences between running a container vs running a service 

Docker service is used mostly when you configured the master node with Docker swarm so that docker containers **will run in a distributed environment** and it can be easily managed.

 **Docker run:** The docker run command first creates a writeable container layer over the specified image, and then starts it using the specified command.

That is, docker run is equivalent to the API <u>/containers/create</u> then <u>/containers/(id)/start</u>

 **Docker service:** Docker service will be the image for a microservice within the context of some larger application. Examples of services might include an HTTP server, a database, or any other type of executable program that you wish to run in a distributed environment.

When you create a service, you specify which container image to use and which commands to execute inside running containers. You also define options for the service including:

- the port where the swarm will make the service available outside the swarm
- an overlay network for the service to connect to other services in the swarm
- CPU and memory limits and reservations
- a rolling update policy
- the number of replicas of the image to run in the swarm

### Services, tasks, and containers

When you deploy the service to the swarm, the swarm manager accepts your service definition as the desired state for the service. Then it schedules the service on nodes in the swarm as one or more replica tasks. The tasks run independently of each other on nodes in the swarm.

For example, imagine you want to load balance between three instances of an HTTP listener. The diagram below shows an HTTP listener service with three replicas. Each of the three instances of the listener is a task in the swarm.

A container is an isolated process. In the swarm mode model, each task invokes exactly one container. A task is analogous to a “slot” where the scheduler places a container. Once the container is live, the scheduler recognizes that the task is in a running state. If the container fails health checks or terminates, the task terminates.
